we neeed to consider worst case here
check each floor: 100 falls
binary search: requires 7 eggs to use binary search

best of worst cases is: 
try with nth floor , n +(n-1) floor add 1 floor  lesser than previous one:

n + n-1 + n-2 + n-3 + .... 1 >= 100 
so n = 13.65 ~= 14

n:is floor number from which egg is dropped

it is dynamic prog quest if given k floor and e eggs and to find the minimum no of drops reqd

**** it takes 3 days to reach heaven

=> x = 3
